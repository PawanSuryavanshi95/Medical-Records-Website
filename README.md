We are  going to make a website for the purpose of connecting patients with doctors and managing medical records of patients. On this website, patients and doctors can register and doctors can post reports of patients and also view the previous history of patient on his/her’s approval for better understanding of his/her problem. Every record of a patient is secure and can only be seen by doctors approved by patients. 
 
 
Addon Feature (future) : 
 
As an addon patients could also contact doctors through this website and both can communicate on this website and we can also extend it to video conference in future where patients can consult doctors and then doctors can make an appointment online with a patient with minor problems and can treat him/her on the basis of the communication and the past medical history of the patient. 
 
 
Advantages  : 
 
● There will be no fuss of maintaining medical records either by the patient or the doctor. 
● This also reduces piling up of papers and hard copy of reports. 
● Reports made by multiple doctors for a patient can be viewed by a doctor, so in a way their work is shared very easily on this site. 
● This reduces the time spent on finding and reaching previous medical consultants to gain the knowledge of patient’s past history. 
● Provides an easy way of keeping track of medical history. 
● Records are very secure. 
 
Further Advantages of addon  : 
 
● No need to visit doctors for minor problems. 
● Saves time. 
● Saves fuel. 
● Doctor can keep track of progress of treatment through communication. 
● It would be really easy to approach doctors.
